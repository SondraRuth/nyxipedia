Kate had taken a break for about 2 months to let her voice recover from some serious strain. This episode was also the first with \u0026ldquo;The Part Where I Talk\u0026rdquo; including a proto-version of the jingle.\nI wanna tell you a story, about why I became the type of musician that I am today. Because there are times in my life that I was definitely different, uh, types of musician. I was definitely playing different types\u0026ndash; genres of music, and had certain goals. And I can boil down why I became the performer that I am today to this one show that I attended that was super influential for just my life as a whole, like, as a performer. And also influential for how I conducted myself at shows, and what it meant to put on a show, and what a show could contain. So, this had to have been ten years ago or so, probably. Um. I would have been\u0026hellip; After tour, maybe late 2010, early 2011. Um. There was a show\u0026ndash; Jason Webley, for those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know, is, a long time collaborator of Amanda Palmer. He\u0026rsquo;s an amazing musician in his own right. He does sort of, like, uh, vagabond punk cabaret music. \u0026hellip; So, I am in my early 20\u0026rsquo;s, I would say 20 or 21, and my\u0026ndash; I decide to go to this Jason Webley show with my sister and her girlfriend at the time. Um, Jason Webley, for those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know, I was just explaining, is a long time collaborator of Amanda Palmer, most famously, probably, a part of Evelyn Evelyn, if those of\u0026ndash; if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with her work around that time. Um, problematic project, but Jason Webley is a great musician and performer and person. Um, so I go with my sister and her girlfriend to this show and I pay less than twenty dollars for all of us to get in because the show is being held at this place called the Trumbullplex. If you\u0026rsquo;re not from Detroit, the Trumbullplex is basically like an old house, like an old\u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s not Victorian, it\u0026rsquo;s\u0026ndash; but it looks Victorian to me because all big, old houses look Victorian to me. It\u0026rsquo;s this\u0026ndash; \u0026hellip; So it\u0026rsquo;s this big Victorian house that has a garage, kind of. It\u0026rsquo;s just basically like an additional room. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a garage, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of another house that\u0026rsquo;s like attached to the house? And they held punk shows there at the Trumbullplex. It was just this giant open space that had like graffiti and stickers and Christmas lights all over it. It looked like what you think a, like, crustpunk artsy venue of that type would look like. At six bucks a person to get in, and the only person performing that night, I believe, is Jason Webley. And Jason Webley performs with just a pallet to stomp on for percussion and an accordion. And he plays a lot of beautiful music throughout the night. He plays a parody of his own song with Evelyn Evelyn. He plays some of his more famous works. He plays all sorts of music. But, about a third of the way through the show, he stops the show and says, \u0026ldquo;Okay, this is how things are gonna work from now on. We\u0026rsquo;re all going to pretend, that there is this song in the nineties, called Hockey Star. And Hockey Star was one of those songs that everyone knew, it was all over the place in the early to mid nineties. Hockey Star was a huge deal.\u0026rdquo; And he describes to us how this song that \u0026ldquo;we all know,\u0026rdquo; supposedly. That we are all\u0026ndash; all learning of at that time. He\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026ldquo;You all know this song from the mid nineties. And the only reason you\u0026rsquo;ve come to this show tonight is because I\u0026rsquo;m the Hockey Star guy. Like the only reason you showed up and paid your six bucks to get in the door to come to my show tonight is because I\u0026rsquo;m the Hockey Star guy and that\u0026rsquo;s what you know me from.\u0026rdquo; And he tells the audience everyone knew this song. \u0026ldquo;Hockey Star was such a big deal, and you knew all the words to it and everyone knew the dance.\u0026rdquo; And he\u0026rsquo;s describing all these ways that things \u0026ldquo;were\u0026rdquo; in the nineties for this song. And he plays a couple of chords on his accordion and he says, \u0026ldquo;Okay, when you hear this grouping of chords, later in the show, I need you to lose your minds. I need you to go crazy.\u0026rdquo; And everyone is just like, \u0026ldquo;Okay\u0026hellip; alright. I guess this is just happening.\u0026rdquo; Um. \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;So when you hear these chords,\u0026rdquo; he informs the audience. \u0026ldquo;When you hear these chords, you gotta go absolutely insane.\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip;\nSo he plays these couple chords and he informs us of our instructions, that when we hear these\u0026ndash; when we hear the song, the reason that we\u0026rsquo;re all here tonight, we have to go insane. So. \u0026hellip; So he continues with the rest of his set, and he continues playing beautiful cabaret music, and this vagabond music, and just having, like, doing his thing. His normal Jason Webley thing. And then. Right before the show is about to be done. He plays those four chords. And everyone loses. Their. Minds. The place goes ballistic. It is insane. Everyone is losing their shit, like, we are watching a solo Backstreet Boy play the only Backstreet Boys song any of us knew. And he played this nineties pop song that he had written, um, as a side project with some other friends of his. He played this nineties pop song on accordion\u0026ndash; er, nineties-style pop song, on accordion, and we all lost our shit! And we were all doing a da\u0026ndash; Like, everybody was looking at each other, trying to figure out what the \u0026ldquo;dance\u0026rdquo; was that went to Hockey Star and we were all in this alternate reality game for the rest of his show. And that experience of being led through storytelling basically, like, being dragged through a story as a part of this one person act, to me, was\u0026ndash; That changed everything for me. It was\u0026ndash; It completely opened all doors as to what was possible. What I could be capable of and what solo performance was capable of doing. Because that moment is completely unreplicatable. Like, I\u0026ndash; that experience was one of the funnest, most enjoyable concerts I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to, and it was in part because he took the risk to be like, \u0026ldquo;No, this is a story that we\u0026rsquo;re all a part of and we\u0026rsquo;re all in it together.\u0026rdquo; And it\u0026rsquo;s just one of those moments that I look back into my life\u0026ndash; look back to in my life that I think of as completely formative of my art and who I am, because he made the story happen whether we liked it or not. And it was amazing to be a part of. But yeah. That is my story of tonight. Of my\u0026ndash; of when I went to a Jason Webley concert and everything changed. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash; like, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t because of lights, or ext\u0026ndash; er, or makeup, or excess, or anything. He literally was just like, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re doing this. This is what\u0026rsquo;s happening. This is the way the show is gonna go.\u0026rdquo; And, it just\u0026ndash; I was\u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t know! I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you could just be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, we\u0026rsquo;re all playing make-believe now.\u0026rdquo; (whispering) And now I do that all the time.\nKate Nyx S02E01 Setlist # Black Sky Lullaby - Kate Nyx Kiss From a Rose - Seal Annabelle - Kate Nyx Hey There - Kate Nyx sell out! - Kate Nyx heroine - Kate Nyx "},{"id":5,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-3/s03e01/","title":"S03E01","section":"Season 3","content":" S03E01 # Lullaby Lounge: Season Threason Premiere\nAired: 2020-09-15 Posted: 2020-11-02\nThis episode was the first of season 3. A theme song was introduced, which would carry over through the end of the run of the series. Kate also teased viewers with \u0026ldquo;Violet Delacour and Her Many Secrets,\u0026rdquo; a fanfiction she wrote when she was ten years old. Parts of the story were read during the stream. A dramatic reading and complete score of it as a radio play was added as a patron goal on her Patreon.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s weird, we\u0026rsquo;re not gonna read that part.

And I have strength so immense I could lift up a building. I am an expert at martial arts. I could kill Voldemort with a nod of my head. And I can blink. (Blinking is where you think about a place, and you\u0026rsquo;re there.) That\u0026rsquo;s in there. I had to tell you. The explanation of blinking is in the text. Which is actually pretty, um, close to the spell in D\u0026amp;D. I was not playing Dungeons and Dragons at this point in time, but it\u0026rsquo;s there. (Blinking is where you think about a place, and you\u0026rsquo;re there.) I can freeze time, without the spell I used. I can do anything, and yet, I am still muggle-born. I can read minds. I can sense evil. And I can tell if someone is behind me or not. It is amazing what I can do. And only Eliza and I know where I got it from. When I was a little girl, a horrible accident occurred.

Quoted below is a particularly interesting story about Kate\u0026rsquo;s background in the renaissance faire that was told during this episode.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to tell my story tonight of when I used to work at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. Um. For those of you who didn\u0026rsquo;t know, or couldn\u0026rsquo;t guess, I worked at a renaissance faire from ages fourteen to seventeen. And two of those years were on cast. So I was a part of the character acting troupe that was coached and, like, put together produced by the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. I started as a vendor when I was fourteen, and I vended\u0026ndash; er, I worked for a dragon seller. I was one of those people that, like, had the puppet on their shoulder and, like, convinced you to buy this dragon puppet, that like\u0026hellip; what the hell are you ever gonna use it for? But it was my job to hock these, like, ninety dollars, um, these ninety dollar dragon puppets that just sat on your shoulder and you controlled with a cable. And I\u0026ndash; my parents, my mother and my stepfather, had actually gotten married at the renaissance faire, and I had expressed wanting to work there since I was a very young child. Like, I had always wanted to work at the ren faire. Um, partially because I think I wanted to just play pretend all day, but there\u0026rsquo;s just something about that place that was very significant to my development as a creator, as a producer of art. Um, I auditioned for faire twice. The first time I didn\u0026rsquo;t get in, cause I think partially I was too young. Um. And then after the year where I was a dragon seller for a certain amount of weekends, and the people on cast had started to sort of recognize me and notice that I was trying to become one of them, I auditioned at fifteen\u0026ndash; it would have been my freshman year of high school. Um, and, I got in! I was the youngest member on cast at that time. I actually, like, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even get a callback. They just handed me a contract before I walked out the door. Um. They\u0026hellip; I was hired immediately. Um. I learned later it was because, one, because I auditioned well. And two, because of this woman who played Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley, the pirate queen for many years there. Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily\u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m not\u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t know if she wants to be, like, connected to PARF these days, but, um, we\u0026rsquo;re just gonna call her Grace. Because she was Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley to me before we became friends, so she\u0026rsquo;s sort of always going to be Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley to me in my head. So, I auditioned to be in the cast and I was\u0026hellip; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash; I was\u0026ndash; First of all, I love doing homework. So I made up my own character. A lot of the times when you work for PARF, they\u0026rsquo;ll just hand you a character and be like \u0026ldquo;this is who you are\u0026rdquo; but there is an option to pitch a character to them. And the character I pitched was Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s cabin girl, um, Flintlock Fiona. And Flintlock Fiona was an Irish, young Irish pirate, a teenage Irish Pirate, and she was the cabin girl on Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; So I pitched this character of Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s cabin girl. And they were like, \u0026ldquo;fine, you can be a cabin girl, that\u0026rsquo;s cool with us.\u0026rdquo; But then it turned out during the season that there was another teenage character that was central to the plot. So, like, I had pitched my character to them, Flintlock, and she was a little rough-and-tumble cabin girl (at this moment, Kate switches to an Irish accent) with an Irish accent, and I got to do whatever I wanted, and act like a little brat all the time. Um, just like very, like, determined little pirate girl. Lots of anger, very rough-and-tumble. (Kate returns to her normal speaking voice) Um. And. I was very hype about being able to be Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s cabin girl, and I got to hang out with Grace all the time, being her cabin girl. But there was this part of the plot that was central to the day\u0026rsquo;s plot, which was \u0026hellip;\nSo I was sort of jealous of this other plot character. Um, she was playing Grace\u0026rsquo;s daughter. And as part of the day that happened every day at faire, because it was sort of like Groundhog Day at PA. Every day was a new\u0026ndash; was the same thing, happened over and over again. Morgan got captured in the morning, and then she got free, and then she gets captured at mid-day, and then, like, it was this whole thing where the pirates were against the privateers, and there was this big kidnapping plot, with Morgan and I clearly wanted to be Morgan O\u0026rsquo;Malley because I just wanted to be Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s daughter so bad. So I had this, sort of, like, feeling for the first half of the season where I\u0026rsquo;m being weird and competitive with this girl, and this girl is just an actor person who doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care about ren faire, and, um, I am just acting my little heart out all the time, doin\u0026rsquo; all my stuff. And then, mid-season\u0026ndash; Yes, Westworld vibes 100%, Holly. I\u0026ndash; I very much felt connected emotionally to Westworld, because it reminded me of working at the renaissance faire. Um. Hell yeah, Grace! Privateers are just ocean cops! All cops are bastards! \u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a weird season because, on one hand, I\u0026rsquo;m living my dream of working at the renaissance faire, and get to work at\u0026ndash; hang out with the pirates all the time and do a bunch of cool pirate stuff. And then, halfway through the season, the girl that\u0026rsquo;s playing Morgan quits. And, part of the reason why she was hired was because she\u0026rsquo;s eighteen years old and legally allowed to do the stunt show. But then they didn\u0026rsquo;t have anyone to fill her place, who was over-age and could make all the dates. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I stopped going to high school. Because I quit high school to become Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley\u0026rsquo;s daughter. And I, um, I worked there every weekend, and all the school days, and it was my job to be captured in the morning, and then free myself, and then get captured again in mid-day, and then for the big joust at the end of the day there was this big stunt show, that I to, like, run through fire, and like\u0026ndash; I had to basically dodge all the stunts, because legally I wasn\u0026rsquo;t technically supposed to be on the structure. Um, I had to dodge all this, like, stunt stuff, and do a little bit of acting during the show at this big joust every day, every day that faire happened. So, twice a weekend? I also had to be there in the morning to practice it and such, because we had to make sure all the charges and stuff for the special effects were all fine, and all this stuff. I basically got a ton of extra acting homework, which I clearly loved. So, maybe the second time I do the joust, this is when I really realized that, like, I had the power to make people feel things. And that renaissance faire was different, because it was like everyone existed in the same place at the same time. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t like theater, where you do something and then people know you\u0026rsquo;re not you. It was a different space. So, I run down the stairs as part of the joust. I like, I have to punch this cop, first, gotta punch this cop, break my handcuffs, um, run down the stairs, dodge around the fire, and then my\u0026ndash; the woman who plays my mother, Grace O\u0026rsquo;Malley, is across from me on the stage. Um, I have to run to her around other fire, I think. And I\u0026hellip; this probably would have been the second day I did it, so the first weekend that it happened. When I run to Grace, I yell, \u0026ldquo;Mama!\u0026rdquo; and Queen Elizabeth cried! I\u0026rsquo;m crying just thinking about it. I mean, that moment when the woman who played Queen Elizabeth at the time, cause she was supposed to be sort of, like, lording over whatever was happening\u0026hellip; Um, she came up to me, and she\u0026ndash; she held my face because it made\u0026ndash; it made sense in character for her to be generous towards me. But, she came up to me and she held my face and she just said, \u0026ldquo;You called her \u0026lsquo;Mama\u0026rsquo;,\u0026rdquo; and she, like, had tears running down her face. And that moment, where I was like, \u0026ldquo;Oh shit! It\u0026rsquo;s not just the audience that I\u0026rsquo;m\u0026ndash; I can make feel things. It\u0026rsquo;s also the other people who are in the space with me.\u0026rdquo; Changed my life. Also the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve had people ask for my autograph. Because, um, there was a little girl that saw me at the diner after the\u0026ndash; after faire ended, and she asked me for my autograph. So\u0026hellip; It was just a lot of experiences all at once that I think solidified what it meant to be a performer, and to be a part of theater, and what theater could do. Because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash; Cause Kate was in it with me, right? She could\u0026ndash; She had\u0026ndash; She could manager her feelings the way the rest of us could to make whatever happened and it was just different. It, it solidified that I could make people feel things for real. So yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s my story, about playing the daughter of a pirate queen for\u0026ndash; instead of going to high school.\nKate Nyx S02E02 Setlist # Glitter and Gold - Barns Courtney Ballad of the Bard - Kate Nyx Go Go Power Rangers - Ron Wasserman (from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) Warrior of Love - Kate Nyx Dead Souls - Nine Inch Nails (originally by Joy Division) What Would Peggy Carter Do? - Kate Nyx A Faerie Ballad - Kate Nyx "},{"id":8,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-3/s03e02/","title":"S03E02","section":"Season 3","content":" S03E02 # LULLABY LOUNGE S3 Boy Bands Through The Ages\nAired: 2020-09-22 Posted: 2020-11-02\nKate: \u0026ldquo;Alright.

We have all given each other permission to participate in the experience that is this show.

This week\u0026rsquo;s part where I talk is a little bit of a story, not so much a\u0026ndash; well, there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a message to it. We\u0026rsquo;ll see where it goes. Um. So, back in the before times, um, back right around, right before I started, before I released my third record, idiot child., which some of you may have, and is available on Bandcamp and streaming platforms and everywhere if you would like to hear it. idiot child. is everywhere. Um, back before I was about to release idiot child., I was writing a lot of music, obviously, given I was about to release an album, and the partner I was with at the time was sort of involved in my career. We said he was my manager, really he was just kind of abusive and overbearing. Um, but, I was writing a lot of quiet, folky music that was quite sad, because, um, that dude was an abusive fuckhole and I was writing songs about our relationship, so a lot of it was really depressing. And he said to me, and I have internalized this wholly, he said to me, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so excited for when you no longer write sad little girl music.\u0026rdquo; And I seriously took that to heart. I took to heart that I was writing music that was somehow lesser because it was very feminine and very emotion-driven. Um, I have always wanted to write music that you could dance to and write music that was upbeat, that you could play at a rock concert and people would celebrate with you. And\u0026hellip; Fuck that dude, indeed. Um, it\u0026rsquo;s the Spider, so, that guy, we all know that dude\u0026rsquo;s a dickhead. No, um, no\u0026hellip; Everyone knows that about the mythology, I believe. \u0026hellip; So I just completely, like, that was a huge part of, um, just my idea of myself. That I was somehow\u0026ndash; what I was making was not as good as, um, it could be. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t living up to my potential because of what I was writing, and I have, over the years, sort of come to terms with my sad little girl music. Because it\u0026rsquo;s what I write. Like, I write songs from the heart. I write songs that are from my insides, and sometimes I\u0026rsquo;m a sad little girl. And sometimes you just need to be a sad little girl, as I have said many times on the stream and off. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to feel your fucking feelings and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that my \u0026ldquo;sad little girl music\u0026rdquo; opens a door that some people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to access otherwise, because they too have internalized this idea that emotionality is bad, that emotionality makes you feminine and that makes you bad. And whilst sad little girl music used to be this sort of\u0026ndash; I used to feel it was like a shroud that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t shake off, like I was holding myself back by being who I am? Which doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. Um, obviously if I was being authentic to myself, then it\u0026rsquo;s what I should have been writing. And clearly that authenticity will\u0026ndash; it resonates with you, with people, and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that my sad little girl music, it has a serious and important place in music as a whole, which is that there is music that is for catharsis. And I feel so grateful that I have found the\u0026ndash; my calling. And that I create and I play music that allows people to visit the more emotional side of themself, visit the more feminine side of themselves. \u0026hellip; The sad little girl music is relatable to anyone who has been hurt. And I think it also reflects really poorly upon him that he had so little connection to his emotions and was so\u0026ndash; had so little connection to what was happening between us, and like the reality of what was happening between us, that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t see what I was making, and he felt the need to infantilize it and demean it. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming as a way to control me, because what else would be the point of that, right? Like, there\u0026rsquo;s not really a point to telling your eighteen year old \u0026ldquo;girlfriend-not-a-girlfriend\u0026rdquo;, um, that her music is not as good as it could be, except to control her. \u0026hellip; So I just\u0026ndash; I wanted to talk to you about that, about how it\u0026rsquo;s important to, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, be true to yourself and to take the things that people say to try and demean you and use them as armor to go through the world. Because that\u0026rsquo;s really what I feel, like I\u0026rsquo;ve\u0026hellip; I used to feel so upset with myself that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make happier music or make more upbeat music. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, sometimes it gets upbeat more recently, um, at least more aggressive, and\u0026hellip; And, uh, yeah. Just be who you are.

It also featured the premiere of Bean Gotta Scream, and an early rendition of a Lullaby Lounge theme.\nI have a lot of feelings right now. And, to be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what I\u0026rsquo;m gonna talk about tonight. Uh, so much has happened in the last 24 hours, and the last six months of, not just the world, but our lives specifically. And so many ups and downs have happened, and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so many things about myself and about about others and about what I am capable of and about what others are capable of. And I think right now, what I wanna talk about is success. Because I believe myself to be experiencing some form of it. And as you can tell by the fact that there are tears in my eyes, that makes me uncomfortable. What\u0026rsquo;s with that? Why does doing good make me sad? Um, I think, in part, it\u0026rsquo;s because I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know what my life was gonna look like when I was younger. The\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve been building things myself for so long, I\u0026rsquo;d assumed that one day someone would snap me up and tell me that what I did was good and I would be a part of something bigger than myself. And I\u0026rsquo;d never found a place that made sense for me to succeed in. And I guess it turns out I made one. And it\u0026rsquo;s hard to see that as success because I built it, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see it for what it is from the outside. Um. I\u0026rsquo;ve made more money this year on music than I have in the past several years combined. Um. I, um, I\u0026rsquo;ve been\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of different things and I\u0026rsquo;ve failed at them in many different ways to get here. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken big steps that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready for, and I\u0026rsquo;ve faced consequences of going too hard, too fast, in many different ways. And this place isn\u0026rsquo;t that. I built it so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. The reason there is a season finale, and I don\u0026rsquo;t just continue streaming music on into oblivion is because \u0026hellip; throughout these fifteen years of promoting my music online, of promoting myself and my work and my personality and the things that I do online, of making makeup tutorials, and doing vlogs, and learning how to edit video, and learning all the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to come here, and doing all the different things and careers, and being in burlesque for so long, and starting a production company with my best friend\u0026hellip; making strides in industries that would never be noticed. I\u0026rsquo;m learning that I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get the external validation that I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. And it hurts right now. But I\u0026rsquo;ve found internal validation. In part, because of you, because of the Kate-riarchy, because of my lodestars\u0026hellip; of you willing to dedicate your time to me, I eventually came around to the idea that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be showing up every week if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t something worth watching. I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful for that and for you, for how much time and money and effort you\u0026rsquo;ve spent here. Things are changing in my world and in the world around us. And I hope you expect every season of the Lullaby Lounge to look slightly different, because I will be at a different time in my life. But I have found my identity here, and I like it. I like it here. And I\u0026rsquo;m learning that you like it here too.\nKate Nyx S02E07 Setlist # What Would Peggy Carter Do? - Kate Nyx Teenage Dirtbag - Wheatus Annabelle - Kate Nyx Arise, Fair Sun - Kate Nyx Rainbow Lemonade and Gin - Kate Nyx Lean on Me - Bill Withers Girl All the Bad Guys Want - Bowling for Soup Everything Stays - Rebecca Sugar (Adventure Time) Lullaby Lounge Theme Demo - Kate Nyx Kiss From a Rose - Seal "},{"id":29,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-3/s03e07/","title":"S03E07","section":"Season 3","content":" S03E07 # LULLABY LOUNGE S3 Halloween Finale\nThe spooky season finale!

It is not a child. It has lived through a life and it is not a child anymore. But it is not necessarily what people like of you in society, eh? The part of you that is feeling the deep feelings, that is worried about change, that wants to scream and shout and dance and sing and cry and hide. It is not a child anymore. So how do we refer to it? Yes, you could say it is your inner child, but it is older. It is fully grown. And it is still very feral. How do we refer to this part of us? So I make goblin. Goblin is the inner child that is grown. It is maybe not grown in the best circumstances, did not get to be a grown up like grown full adult. It did not get to stay a child inside of you as the outer part grew. Because it saw something or it did something or what have you. But. It is there. We have to be kind to it, we have to be nice to it, we have to see it as a part of our selves without feeling like we are completely disassociating from the part of us that is at our core. So. Goblin. The inside of you that is feral and strange and hard to like and too loud and offputting and too much, is enough in goblin. Perfect amount.

It also has a whole lot of important quotes, including an explanation of Kate referring to her community as LODESTARs.\nAlright. Who is ready TO ROCK? I know that I started this in a little bit of a flustered state. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to taking out that pent up energy and anger at myself and putting it into something worthwhile, using music. That is one of the greatest things, I think, like, one of the most important parts of this live stream is that without my music, I sort of have this pent up aggression, rage, depression, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anywhere to go. And it ends up seeping into my day-to-day life in really negative ways. But I find that when I\u0026rsquo;m playing music, specifically when I\u0026rsquo;m playing music for a live audience, be that in streams or else-wise, then I can sort of use that energy that I would use to just beat myself up or be negative to bring art into the world and process those emotions, and use them as a way to help other people who are having issues with aggression, or depression, et cetera, to, um, you know, use it for something better than that. To process those feelings on their own terms and, you know, just get through whatever it is they\u0026rsquo;re going through.\nKate Nyx S01E20092 I went for it! I went for it! \u0026hellip; Wow. That fucked up my neck somehow. Oof. My eyelash is coming of. Somehow I hurt my neck singing that. All my arms and limbs is tingly. I went too hard. I might have rocked too hard. My poor, little meatsack body is, um\u0026hellip; Hoo. Hooooooo. I rocked too hard. I rocked too hard. I think I am gonna\u0026hellip; Hoo. Wow. That hurt. Like, legitimately. That hurt me!

I\u0026rsquo;ll break \u0026rsquo;em! I\u0026rsquo;ll break every rowdy bone in my body for the sake of rock and roll! Seriously, that really messed up my neck. I think it\u0026rsquo;s how the strap gripped on my slick, extremely sweaty body. For those of you that don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m a sweaty-ass lady. I\u0026rsquo;m, like, one of the sweatiest ladies I know. Um. Lindsey Noel can back me up, I\u0026rsquo;m an extremely sweaty lady. She has seen the, the, level at which my\u0026hellip; My underboob is like, actually, secretly a teleportation system to Niagara Falls, and the amount of liquid that dispenses from the underside of my breast\u0026ndash; It\u0026rsquo;s honestly revolutionary. I should be given a prize.\nKate Nyx After playing You Oughta Know So, for a long time, I\u0026rsquo;ve been sort of, like, trying to figure out how to\u0026hellip; What to call y\u0026rsquo;all. Because I have\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t like \u0026ldquo;fans\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;followers\u0026rdquo; because I think that really discounts how much y\u0026rsquo;all mean to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t like calling just y\u0026rsquo;all my \u0026ldquo;fans.\u0026rdquo; Because whilst you might be a fan of what I do, um, I just think it\u0026rsquo;s diminishing. I don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash; I think it\u0026rsquo;s not, um, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the depth of our relationship. I think it\u0026rsquo;s un\u0026ndash; I think it\u0026rsquo;s not the right word. \u0026ldquo;Follower\u0026rdquo; I think is even worse, because it makes me feel like a cult leader. Though, we have determined that I am allowed to say hell because the Friday stream is now church. Shout out to my Rowdy Bones Gang!\nSo I didn\u0026rsquo;t like calling y\u0026rsquo;all \u0026ldquo;fans\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;followers,\u0026rdquo; and for a long time I would say \u0026ldquo;party members\u0026rdquo; because, like, we\u0026rsquo;re an adventuring party together. But, even that, I felt like that was diminishing the connection that we have and how important your opinion is to me. Um\u0026hellip; I feel like calling you my \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; is not only pretentious, it\u0026rsquo;s also presumptuous. And I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a word that I liked that was appropriate for what y\u0026rsquo;all are to me.\nSo, I recently\u0026ndash; I recently had this sort of epiphany. \u0026hellip; I had an epiphany the other night when I was writing out an Instagram caption. Because I called you, in just a colloquial way, I called you my \u0026ldquo;lodestars.\u0026rdquo; Now, a lodestar is a guiding star, like the North Star. Um, or any, either of the pole stars. It\u0026rsquo;s an old English term meaning a star that is used to guide a ship. And I thought that was so appropriate, because you really are a huge part of what guides, not only my direction as an artist, but how successful I am. Like, your contributions to the Kate-riarchy, whether you share and like and comment on stuff, it really does make or break, like, this experience. It can, whether you comment on something and interact with something, can make a post live or die, which means that many people don\u0026rsquo;t see me or do see me. And it also, I think, is indicative of just how much your opinion can shape the content here in the Kate-riarchy. Whether it means that I\u0026rsquo;m doing a rock set and taking requests, or what I wear, or what I do my makeup as. Or just, in general, the things that happen here. The fact that there could be a Family Friday stream. That stuff is all because of your contributions to this space. And I think that the word lodestar, spelled l-o-d-e-s-t-a-r, is a perfect description of what you all are to me. You are my lodestars. You are the guiding light that helps me when I have lost my way. When I feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing next, or, like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;m going, I turn to you for your opinion. For your creativity. For your feelings on the matter. And that is a huge part of how I choose to conduct business and create here in this space. Um. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing I could possibly call you. So, I hope that you like that word too. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of a weird, old word, which I think was suitable, because I\u0026rsquo;m a weird, old lady. I\u0026rsquo;m a weird, old bog witch. And, um, I hope that you can take this word and feel empowered by it. And know that your contribution to this space is just as, if not more, important than my contribution to it. \u0026hellip; We really are all in this together. And I think that that term is the best way to show you all just what it means\u0026ndash; what YOU mean to me.\nKate Nyx After playing Bet It On the Bootstraps Setlist # Beautiful Dead - Kate Nyx You Oughta Know - Alanis Morissette What You Feel - Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Once More, With Feeling Bet It On the Bootstraps - Kate Nyx Kiss From a Rose - Seal Please Share - Kate Nyx In Your Grave - Kate Nyx Heartbreaker - Pat Benatar Dead Men Can\u0026rsquo;t Catcall - Kate Nyx Shapeshifter - Josie and the Pussycats I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor "},{"id":42,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-1/s01e20099/","title":"S01E20099","section":"Season 1","content":" S01E20099 # Lullaby Lounge: Soothing Springtime\nAired: 2020-04-08\nThe previous week\u0026rsquo;s show was really intense, so Kate made this one a lot more low key and chill. Lots of slower, quieter songs, after nearly blowing out her voice the previous week.\nOne of the things that, um, I get kind of\u0026hellip; When the trolls do come for me, on the rare occasion, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen that often. When the trolls do come for me, their favorite thing, it is their favorite thing, so\u0026hellip; just the favorite thing. The trolls love to come at me for attention seeking. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to break it to them, but like, if I wanted to make art just for myself and for it never to get attention, I would not put it on the internet. So when people tell me that I\u0026rsquo;m attention seeking, I\u0026rsquo;m just like, \u0026ldquo;Yes. Yes, I am. And you are seeking attention from me by coming at me.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;re all seeking attention and it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Because that attention that we crave, that human connection that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for, is the validation, the need to feel reflected and understood. The need to see someone as a mirror and feel you\u0026rsquo;re\u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re on the same page as you, you know? That\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with seeking attention or external validation, as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only way that you develop your own value. It\u0026rsquo;s so important that you be kind to yourself about seeking human connection. You are not meant to spend all of our time alone, never talking to each other, and only working. We were meant to experience art together, to see things together, to be in clubs, et cetera! Which is why this time is so hard, and why places like the Lullaby Lounge are so important. It\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful that you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to stop in today.\nKate Nyx S01E20099 This dress is cute. But I have sweat through it.

I\u0026rsquo;m realizing this because people tell me that the things I say are strange, or that I go too fast, or that I\u0026rsquo;m\u0026hellip; being whatever I\u0026rsquo;m being. Insert fuckin\u0026rsquo; adjective here that\u0026rsquo;s another reason for me to hate myself. Basically, I try not to listen to it. But\u0026hellip; Because I\u0026rsquo;m just tired. I\u0026rsquo;m tired of having to try and fit myself into other people\u0026rsquo;s bullshit. The reason I created this space was specifically because I didn\u0026rsquo;t fit into other people\u0026rsquo;s bullshit and I had to make my own goddamn party because god knows I\u0026rsquo;m not gettin\u0026rsquo; invited to anyone else\u0026rsquo;s. Because why would they? I understand. I\u0026rsquo;m a lot of person. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that you\u0026rsquo;re here. Cause you\u0026rsquo;re like, \u0026ldquo;You see that? That girl who\u0026rsquo;s a lot? Me too, bud.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s nice to know that there\u0026rsquo;re other people who\u0026rsquo;s brains are racing at a violent speed.\nKate Nyx Basically, if y\u0026rsquo;all weren\u0026rsquo;t here every week, hangin\u0026rsquo; out with me in the Lullaby Lounge, then I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the one\u0026hellip; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing it. Because there\u0026rsquo;d be no one to perform to. I don\u0026rsquo;t play music just for myself. I know that probably seems selfish. Um. I\u0026hellip; But I play music to be heard. I play music to feel reflected, to feel, um, understood! I play it\u0026ndash; I play music because\u0026hellip; To people. For people to hear! I produce it and perform it and promote it because the feeling of being understood when a song is played will forever trump the feeling of being understood when I\u0026rsquo;m speaking. There will never be\u0026ndash; I cannot speak honestly. I feel that. Like, I feel like I cannot express enough\u0026hellip; of what\u0026rsquo;s hapenning in just words and intonation and language. Music is an undeniable thing. Notes, put in a certain order, we\u0026rsquo;ve been trained from birth, essentially, by cinema, to understand certain keys and sounds as certain feelings. And when you add that language, that vocabulary of sound, of notes, and melody, you add that language on top of lyrics. That, to me, is the most pure and honest form of communication, because you can\u0026rsquo;t deny that a song is happy or sad. Obviously, like, yes, you could change the arrangement or the chords, and you could make certain melodies sound different, but when you hear (Kate vocalizes the opening to Beethoven\u0026rsquo;s Fifth Symphony), you know that\u0026rsquo;s scary. And\u0026hellip; you know, things like that. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that makes sense. Some of you seem to understand. Holly always gets it. I know Holly gets it, because she\u0026rsquo;s been here for ten years. Can you fucking believe that? Holly has been a part of the Kate-riarchy\u0026ndash; and Ellie too! Have been a part of the Kate-riarchy for ten years! Ten years! The fact that you would give a shit about what I\u0026rsquo;m doing ten years after you discover it\u0026hellip; I mean. It\u0026rsquo;s because of you that I can no longer deny that I\u0026rsquo;m good at what I do. Because\u0026hellip; If I was awful and an awful person and I didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve anything good then incredible people like Ellie and Holly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend so much of their time with me. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can express how much the Secret Agent Faerie Expert Team is a part of what\u0026rsquo;s happening. Though they don\u0026rsquo;t appear on screen, they are consulted for decisions about graphics, they\u0026rsquo;re consulted for setlists, they\u0026rsquo;re consulted for, um\u0026hellip; They\u0026rsquo;re obviously trusted moderators. They are\u0026hellip; Um. They help me figure out the tone of things I\u0026rsquo;m writing, they sometimes will hear songs first, or\u0026hellip; You know, there\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; They contribute more than I can possibly explain. Um. Again, I realize I say that a lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s because the words don\u0026rsquo;t say enough. When I say it\u0026rsquo;s more than I can say, it\u0026rsquo;s because the only way I know how to express myself completely and totally truly is with music. And when I say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, this means more than I can express,\u0026rdquo; what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to say\u0026ndash; How many times have I said say? What I\u0026rsquo;m trying to convey is that without music I feel unheard. And the more people hear what I sing and what I say, and the more people understand and see me as a person who is has expressed themselves in this way effectively\u0026hellip; That\u0026rsquo;s what is the most important to me, I think. That\u0026rsquo;s what I care about above all things.\nKate Nyx He\u0026rsquo;s like Dolly Parton. I say that completely unironically. But he has Dolly Parton energy.

Thanks to the support of my audience over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to cultivate something of a life for myself.

If you\u0026rsquo;d like to listen to the whole show as a podcast, you can find it here:\nI wrote it because it\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I feel about my music. I, sort of, realized as I was getting older the place that I held in people\u0026rsquo;s lives. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many people are lucky enough to realize, um, the effect they have on people when they\u0026rsquo;re, like, in the moment and present and alive, so I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful for the experience. Um. But I noticed that the messages that I was getting from people were always like, \u0026ldquo;Oh you helped me through this really difficult time. Your music was a way that I could feel release. It got me through this tough\u0026ndash; this\u0026ndash; these moments in my life, these dark moments in my life.\u0026rdquo; People would tell me really intimate details about themselves. Like, not in a weird way. But, be like, this is the struggle that I went through, that you helped me through, whether or not you knew you were helping me. And from that experience, it happened enough times where I finally wrote a song about that I was like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026ndash; I accept. You\u0026rsquo;re telling me that this is the job that I have been placed on this earth to do. I will do it happily.\u0026rdquo; And this is, like, my first kind of song where I admitted that what I did was helping people and starting to step into my power as a performer, as someone who really, like, got what they were doing on a emotional level. \u0026hellip; It sounds like a drinking song! You know what I mean? It sounds like an old English song that you\u0026rsquo;d sing in a pub with all your friends and I hope that when people listen to it, they can hear the many voices of the other people who are listening to that song and being like, \u0026ldquo;Yes, I am\u0026ndash; The adult way to look at a very difficult situation is that I understand this is not the end of my life. Like, I understand objectively what I\u0026rsquo;m going through will not ruin me. But, golly, why? Why is it hurting so much and why is it happening like this? Why do I have to experience it?\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s why that song is like, \u0026ldquo;If I have to do it, y\u0026ndash; like, this is, this is being human. Unfortunately.\u0026rdquo; You have to deal with the feelings.\nKate Nyx Magic Story Time S01E04 Lyrics # I am not a doctor but I’ll do my best to heal youlisten to my voice and know you'll live another dayI may not be next to you, but know that I can feel youAnd I know what it’s like to live with painI’m not gonna lie to you, life is not a dream come trueBut it won’t be like this every dayNo, it won’t be like this every dayTomorrow may be different, but if it’s not you’ll surviveIf I have to go through all this, then you have to, tooI know sometimes it seems the only option’s suicideBut you and I both know that isn’t trueI’m not gonna sugarcoat, sometimes the only way is hopeSo then hope is what we have to doI guess hopin' will just have to doAnd when hope's big sister faith comes knocking at your doorDon’t pretend you’ve never met beforeYou have to remember it's not like this foreverDon’t have to make the same mistakesI’ll help you find the better placeYou may be in darkness but I swear a light is comingGrab it by the neck and, dammit, drag it if you mustIf you need me, I’ll be here, a-singing and a-strummingAnd I have got your back no matter whatWe’ve got family and friends who can change our story’s endThough it may not ever go awayWe know it’s not like this every day "},{"id":59,"href":"/music/singles/bean-gotta-scream/","title":"BEAN GOTTA SCREAM feat.

I think it might be because I went off my Cymbalta; it was supposed to be helping my nerve pain but it just made me suicidal. I’ve rejected my fair share of SSRIs and I don’t know why I thought this would be different. Now, it’s “just” Flexeril, prescription strength aspirin, 2 hour epsom salt baths, crystals, EFT tapping (I’ve gone full hippie), BCAAs, strength training, and my dry herb vape. And Percocet if shit gets out of hand.\nI’ve always gotten poetic when I was sad, but it isn’t until recently that I’ve started to be able to use that part of me to express other emotions. At some point, I started keeping my music at arm’s length. I’ve been through a lot of weird producer/manager/boyfriend/client relationships that promised a lot of things that didn’t happen or asked things of me I wasn’t ready to give. I’ve taken lessons but I didn’t go to school for music. I didn’t even go to college. I’m not related to anyone famous, nor do I come from money. I’ve just stumbled upon crazy opportunity after crazy opportunity and risked life and limb to make my life an adventure. I’m constantly waiting for Them to Figure Out I’m not really a Musician.\nRight now, my equally reckless adventure partner is asleep next to me, having passed out due to my excellent lullaby skills. You can hear me playing for him on this weird Dropbox link, sorry, can’t upload direct to Patreon from my phone.\nThank you for making my life possible. This song is as much for all of you as it is for him. I really will be here forever keeping the lights on in Wonderland if I’m allowed.\nKate Nyx Patreon Lyrics # I don't know what I did to deserve youMaybe it's the troubles that I've been throughMaybe all that bad luck finally did goodYou make me think, maybe it couldI want to be more than what I have beenI believe our happiness can happenHonestly I would be okay just to surviveI would be delighted with fineI don't have much money but I do have love and timeI cannot repay the debts I oweI hope you don't mind me singing you some words that rhymeHow else am I supposed to let you knowYou make me betterYou make me betterNo matter the weatherLife is good when we're togetherYou make me betterYou make me betterNo matter the weatherLife is good when we're togetherWhat do you say we do this forever?You can't know the paths that I've takenHow little I've learned from my mistakenAdventures that continually lead me to my doomYou'd think I'd learn to stay in my roomI don't have much money but somehow I've got thisGotta hope that this can be enoughCall it natural talent but I work hard for this shitSorry if I sound a little roughLiving like I do, it makes you toughYou make it betterYou make it betterNo matter the weatherLife is good when we're togetherYou make me betterYou make me betterNo matter the weatherLife is good when we're togetherWhat do you say we do this forever?

I had gone on a couple auditions for community theaters , and hadn\u0026rsquo;t made it past callbacks for any of them. I decided, in that moment, to write a musical.

And what it\u0026rsquo;s about. But it\u0026rsquo;s so interesting to me that so many people love that song. And so many people say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s helped me get through this,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s helped calm me down,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s helped do this for me.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s helped people. Like, I get messages about that song, for sure. And I even had a conversation on Twitter about it, recently, with someone. About the meaning of it. And what it meant to people. And so\u0026hellip; If you are easily triggered by talk of emotional abuse, feel free to click away. I won\u0026rsquo;t be upset.\n\u0026hellip;\nSo, um, that song was written\u0026hellip; Originally that song was called Katie, Calm Down. And the reason it was called Katie, Calm Down is because the person that I was with, um, at that time refused to call me any pet names, aside from the ones that my family called me, which was a little weird. But he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call me \u0026ldquo;babe\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; because that was reserved for an official girlfriend. And we were together for three years, and, um, that song is about how \u0026hellip; So, I was in this relationship with this dude, who like wouldn\u0026rsquo;t admit that we were together because I was ten years younger than him. And we were living together, and basically everyone had figured out we were together, but it was still a secret. \u0026hellip; I wrote that song because of how he would talk to me, and he would say, \u0026ldquo;One day, we\u0026rsquo;ll be together.\u0026rdquo; And he would give me this lofty, \u0026ldquo;one day in the future when I matured enough, when I was truly grown,\u0026rdquo; then he would stop just having sex with me and start being in a real relationship with me. And I wrote that song because I was so\u0026hellip; I mean\u0026hellip; Being hidden, being in a relationship that you can\u0026rsquo;t admit you\u0026rsquo;re in\u0026hellip; Being in a secret relationship with someone who you\u0026rsquo;re living with, who is also your talent manager, who controls a good portion of your life\u0026hellip; Like\u0026hellip; I wrote that song\u0026hellip; Long before I finished it I wrote just the chorus. And then I ended up writing the verses after we had split up. That\u0026rsquo;s why I update the lyrics every year to say how long it\u0026rsquo;s been since we\u0026rsquo;re no longer together, because there are still moments in my head where I hear his opinion of me. And how his opinion of me has formed my life. And that song was written from such a place of, like, true trauma connected to my daddy issues and how he filled that place, and how I was just a fucked up person who needed to heal themselves. And I\u0026rsquo;m definitely working on that, and I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten far enough in my life that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so close. \u0026hellip; I wrote that song from a place of, like, real pain. And, um, we call him The Spider, or The Eight-Legged Ring Master, here in the Kate-riarchy, because I lived with him at the circus. Not a metaphor. I literally lived with him at the circus. Um, and, the place that it has in people\u0026rsquo;s lives is so different now. Um, the people who say they were calmed by it, I think it\u0026rsquo;s really representative of what I can do with my art, you know? Like, I can take my worst moments, and my darkest points in my life, and I can\u0026hellip; I, um, I eventually got out of the relationship, obviously. Now I\u0026rsquo;m married to my husband, who\u0026rsquo;s good to me, and we have a business together and a life together and things. And I\u0026rsquo;ve built myself up, and I\u0026rsquo;ve built my life up. So I\u0026rsquo;m no longer in that dark place in the same way. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to sing that song because I don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip; It brings me back to that place. It\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to not sing it and feel those things. And I\u0026rsquo;m trying very hard to see it the way you see it. To see that song through your eyes as the lullaby that it is\u0026hellip; Has become for you. Because that is a much nicer way to think about that song, and I would rather play it and have you enjoy it and feel it that way. But I\u0026rsquo;m still not in a place, necessarily, where I can, um, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I can\u0026rsquo;t detach it yet. It\u0026rsquo;s getting farther away, but I still feel like that nineteen year old girl listening to this dude fuck other women the floor below me in our house that we shared together. I feel like that girl when I sing it. And it\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t sing it very often. \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a tense song. The song is very much about this idea of a future that will never come. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;baby calm down, one day you\u0026rsquo;ll be mine, in time,\u0026rdquo; and he was infantilizing me in this like\u0026hellip; And he would never call me \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;baby\u0026rdquo; was reserved for real partners, and I was not a real partner. I was a secret. But that song is so, it\u0026rsquo;s so connected to him. It\u0026rsquo;s not like Spring Cleaning where I can be like, \u0026ldquo;Fuck you, Spider! Go to hell! Go to spider hell!\u0026rdquo; Calm Down is this soft and, like, small experience of me feeling, like, totally alone. And like no one could help me. I mean\u0026hellip; I, I really do, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to heal in relation to that song. It\u0026rsquo;s hard because it\u0026rsquo;s so connected to my past and that time in my life. Um, the Spider is kinda getting squashed, actually. His life is not where I think he wants it to be. When we were together, we would produce shows together, and we had this lively artistic career together. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he produces that much anymore, outside of being a part of Theater Bizarre, which is why I can\u0026rsquo;t really go back there. \u0026hellip; But I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely made strides since we were together. There are definitely parts of my life that I thought I was never going to be able to surpass the work that I made with him. Um, and there are definitely people who still remember me specifically from the work that I did with him. But also, like, I moved to Philadelphia and fucked his favorite wrestler, and now I\u0026rsquo;m married to that wrestler. It started as a relationship out of spite, but it\u0026rsquo;s genuinely, like, one of the\u0026ndash; I mean, I love my husband so much. So, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely moved past the situation. And now I\u0026rsquo;m in a much healthier marriage, with someone who admit that we are together. Like, that was one of the dealbreakers. I was like, \u0026ldquo;You have to admit that we are together in front of people and on the internet. That is a dealbreaker if you do not talk about me!\u0026rdquo; And I\u0026rsquo;m actually the first, um, partner that my husband ever spoke about online in relation to his career. So, um, yeah. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a cosmic, \u0026ldquo;fuck you.\u0026rdquo; I definitely\u0026hellip; I definitely, like, did it originally out of spite, and then, like, I drove to Philadelphia like, (singing) \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna fuck Ophidian the Cobra and send The Spider to hell!\u0026rdquo; And then I showed up in Philadelphia, and Ophidian and I spent an entire week together, and I was like, \u0026ldquo;Whoops! Guess I\u0026rsquo;m in love with the snake man!

And that was sort of where we started learning out- learning how we were going to work together.\nKate Nyx S01E20055 Lyrics # Intro:Blessed are the meek for they shall inheritDeath from the original dinner, the snake spiritVerse 1:At high noon I killed AmasisShocked the massesLeft him lifeless and masklessThe funky pharaoh thought he had the controlLike Shang tsung I had to steal your soulIn front of my eyes I watched the victories fadeMy dream was unmade, this team was so fakeDespite being woven from the same threadYou're Better off dead with a kick to the headIt was the end of the roundYour Life bar was beaten downLike bane versus the batYou lay broken on the matYou should've listened when stone cold told yaDon't trust anyone especially a cobraIm Not some pet that dances for his masterThe pharaoh was asking for a barbershop disasterYou made us fools I still hear the laughterWas world's dumbest redneck the title you were afterUsed and abused, tattered and tornI was left badly beaten by the twelve summit tourI was fighting battles that were meant to be yoursI had no choice but to settle the scoreDamn Right I'm the villain and I just clocked inI cant deny I've got some devils WithinMy head full of voices,My hands full of sinIt's an insult to say you were OsirianChorus:Strike first strike fast strike hardOnly after disasterCan we be resurrectedStrike first, Strike fast, Strike hardThose without disciplineDie without honorPre verse:If your name was wahooBreak your leg is what is doAnd if superman can't walkThen why should you!Verse 2:Let me remind you what we came here forUnder the sign of Osiris we were bornSoldiers trained in the art of warI closed the portal to acquire final formMy venom mystifies like the Wizard of GoreI get more boos than a liquor storeI strike with the force of a pharaoh's armyNot even UltraMantis could destroy meI rule this ring with an iron clawWreckin luchadors like my name was jawsCall me Judge Dredd I am the lawWhen your up against snake style War is raw Cause IStrike First, Strike Fast, Strike HardOff with their heads checking off my death listGrim reaper armed to the teeth with red mistWhen your in the clutch, you will submitThis is real life fool, their is no twistJust a fade to black, Amasis ain't comin backFinished him off in mortal kombatDon't need a referee, No ones counting to threeI killed Amasis, flawless victoryThe snake spirit lives forever in meOphidian wins, FatalityChorus "},{"id":93,"href":"/music/the-dollhouse-collection/delilah-mayfair/","title":"Delilah Mayfair","section":"The Dollhouse Collection","content":" Delilah Mayfair # Lyrics # No, I've never said it wasn't trueDelilah, dear, I'm still in love with youI see so much of me in your excuseYou're long gone so really what's the use?And you'll neverListen to this recordSo it doesn't matterIf I tell them all what happened, right?And you'll neverSay I will respect herSo I can finally get it out of me what you did that nightShould I let them know how far it went?How far it was gonna go?Should I let them know under the ice how deep the river flows?Should I let them know the words you said?So sweet, so soft, so slowShould I tell them?Should I tell them?Should I tell them you didn't say no?No, I never said it was a lieDelilah, dear, I swore I wouldn't cryBut you can't help what you feel sometimesSo I took your distance as a signAnd you'll neverListen to this recordSo it doesn't matterIf I tell them what you did to meAnd you'll neverSay I will respect herSo I can suck the poison out, bottle it for all to seeShould I let them know how far it went?How far it was gonna go?Should I let them know under the ice how deep the river flows?Should I let them know the words you said?So sweet, so soft, so slowShould I tell them?Should I tell them?Should I tell them you didn't say no?Delilah Mayfair, you didn't say no(x3) "},{"id":94,"href":"/music/demolition/","title":"DEMOlition: An Audio Sketchbook","section":"Music","content":" DEMOlition: An Audio Sketchbook # Track List # Dead Men Can\u0026#39;t Catcall - 02:18 What Would Peggy Carter Do? - 03:08 Partner In Crime - 03:41 Long Sleeves in Summer [I Believe] - 02:31 Stormy Weather [from \u0026#34;Manic Pixie Dream Show\u0026#34;] - 02:43 sellout!

I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of gotten over the imagery as I got older; partially, I think, because I\u0026rsquo;m learning about what those metaphors meant to me as a writer. We talk a lot about my music in therapy; I go weekly or bi-weekly, depending on how I\u0026rsquo;m doing. My music is sometimes extremely forward and sometimes draped with metaphor and sometimes even I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what the fuck I\u0026rsquo;m talking about until later in my life. I have a lot of secrets, even from myself, that effect my day to day life and how I interact with the world to an unbelievable degree. Looking back on my songs later gives me a clue as to how I deal with those secrets, and what I need to work through as an adult. This song is a sweet little update on that theme: I\u0026rsquo;m not in the dollhouse anymore, nor am I made of salt, so me and the Orchestral Kit in Logic have some shit to say.\nKate Nyx Patreon Lyrics # I'm not your dollI'm not your pretty little thingNo, I don't want your diamond ringI'm not your dollI'm not your dollI'm not your pretty little girlDon't want your ribbons or your pearlsI'm not your dollI'm not your dollI'm not some trophy you can ownI wasn't made to keep your homeI'm not your dollI'm not your dollI won't accessorize your lifeDon't want a queen?

And, um, this song is actually kind of about the girl that turned me into a clown. \u0026hellip; I met this girl at an erotic art expo, and she was dressed like a clown. And she told me I would look cute as a clown. And, at the same time, I was kind of\u0026hellip; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really dating this guy. I had moved to Michigan, because of my high school boyfriend who broke up with me the week after prom. Um.

I don\u0026rsquo;t really know, \u0026lsquo;cause he was like a stringy little high school boy, and honestly, who cares? But, I was obsessed with him. And um, I\u0026ndash; whilst I was trying to court this young gentleman, I met my clown girl. And this song was for him, but it mentions her. Um, as a sin. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think\u0026ndash; I\u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t think the sin was being with the clown girl. I don\u0026rsquo;t think my circus girl was the sin.

Here\u0026rsquo;s how I used to introduce this song, when I was playing it on a regular basis at house shows, and concerts, and events. This is how this song would be introduced. \u0026hellip; Imagine\u0026hellip; In, like, ten years, that I\u0026rsquo;m Lady Gaga famous.

And there\u0026rsquo;s a big, red velvet curtain. And a single spotlight, and a vintage microphone on the stage. And I come out in my super sparkly dress. I have, like, a sequined, sparkly dress. And I walk out with my guitar, and I walk up to the microphone. Put on my guitar. I walk up to the microphone. Single spotlight shining on me, everything else is dark. You can see the lights reflecting off of my dress, it\u0026rsquo;s like a disco ball.

Not for a lost love, or a woman I was in love with, but for another queer woman who I am friends with\u0026hellip; Trying to be friends with again. And I wrote this song for her daughter. And I wrote it, I think around her daughter\u0026rsquo;s first birthday. And, um, we fell out of contact due to some actions on her part. But she recently reached out to me again. So, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that the good energy that this song puts into the world will help heal our friendship, because I really miss her, and I really miss being a part of her daughter\u0026rsquo;s life. Um, I\u0026rsquo;m fairy goddaughter to many chil\u0026ndash; fairy godMOTHER to many children all around the world, but it\u0026rsquo;s different to be a fairy godmother to a child in person. And that\u0026rsquo;s something I really miss being a part of my life.\nSo, this song goes out to all the queer moms, um, or moms of queer kids, um, who don\u0026rsquo;t understand that they\u0026rsquo;re in control. And don\u0026rsquo;t hear enough that they\u0026rsquo;re strong in ways that isn\u0026rsquo;t just through survival. Because there\u0026rsquo;s, like, the strength of women, like, \u0026ldquo;Oh, women are so strong, they can endure.\u0026rdquo; But I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about endurance. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, like, power. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about feeling like you have actionable paths in front of you and that you\u0026rsquo;re in control of how you navigate those actions. Um, that\u0026rsquo;s different than being able to endure, which I think the strength of women is often implied to be. Um, and this song isn\u0026rsquo;t just for women, it can be for anyone who needs a lullaby, who needs to hear that they\u0026rsquo;re more than what they look like, or more than the thing they\u0026rsquo;re known best for.

The title is not necessarily final. I am not a prayer person. I don\u0026rsquo;t, like, talk out loud to a deity very often. I have maybe a few times. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know that I believe in a deity. I believe that witchcraft has power over us because we believe in it, which I think is true of basically anything. And if we want to believe in witchcraft, then that\u0026rsquo;s the thing that can have power over us. But, um, there\u0026rsquo;s a spell in it that\u0026rsquo;s for self power, and the words of the spell were, \u0026ldquo;I am the magic, I am the guide, the magic is power, the magic is inside.\u0026rdquo; And I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to just say it out loud, because I felt goofy, so I sang it. And as I started repeating it, I was like, \u0026ldquo;You know what? I think I could actually write a whole song, like based off of this.\u0026rdquo; And the woman who wrote Coloring Book of Shadows actually has\u0026ndash; I posted a video of it on Instagram at one point, and she has responded and said that she enjoys it. So that\u0026rsquo;s nice! It was sort of a collaborative effort between myself and another artist, even as incidentally as it was.\nKate Nyx S01E20036 Lyrics # I am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insidePower is insideFighting battles I alone can winAsking god for too damn long to save me from my sinsHoly father never helped beforeCall upon our mother to end this bloody warI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideThe power is insideI am the ready maiden, strong and fairI am the mother of the land, the ocean's rightful heirI am crone, wise and silver hairedI am the goddess, and the god, the answer to my prayersI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideThe power is insideThe magic is mine, I had it this whole timeI can see past my disease and know that I am good insideI might not be perfect, but at least I'm tryingI'm doing just fine, I'm doing just fineThe magic is mine, I had it this whole timeI can see past my disease and know that I am good insideI might not be perfect, but at least I'm tryingI'm doing just fine, I'm doing just fineI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideI am the magicI am the guideThe magic is powerThe power is insideThe power is inside "},{"id":199,"href":"/music/make-an-entrance-ep/the-mans-choir/","title":"The Man's Choir [Becky Lynch's Theme Revisited]","section":"Make an Entrance EP","content":" The Man\u0026#39;s Choir [Becky Lynch\u0026#39;s Theme Revisited] # Lyrics # (vocalizing without words) "},{"id":200,"href":"/music/unreleased-songs/this-is-not-the-lullaby-lounge/","title":"This Is Not The Lullaby Lounge Theme","section":"Unreleased Songs","content":" This Is Not The Lullaby Lounge Theme # Background # Part of there reason why the tech streams had their own theme song is because this got stuck in my head for over a week.

I was the subject of a lot of rumors; I was one of the first goths in my middle school and it kind of went downhill from there. When I missed the first three weeks of 8th grade because of a custody dispute between my parents, things only got weirder.\nI distinctly remember a group of boys paying me to leave a room once at a dance, after trying to scare me of with some paper crosses; another time, I was asked if I \u0026ldquo;really believed I was a raven\u0026rdquo;, which didn\u0026rsquo;t even make sense to me. I was a natural antagonist, so it was really just fuel for the fire.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if I decided being weird was cool and acted weird, or if I was realizing I was weird and decided that I liked it that way. Either way, originality has always been a theme in my life. Sometimes, I worry my quest for \u0026ldquo;originality\u0026rdquo; in my youth has made me innately Too Weird to be understood be other people.

I was selling sewing machines at the time, and she and her boyfriend were having some problems because, um, he wanted to be polyamorous, and she did not want to be polyamorous. And I wrote this song for her as a way to sort of get through the difficulties of having those conversations, and, um, just to sort of help her through that time. So if you hear it and it helps you through a difficult time, either in a relationship or else-wise, I\u0026rsquo;m so glad that\u0026rsquo;s true.
